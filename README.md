# Quark-Gluon-Plasma

This code simulates the movement of two quarks intially placed back-to-back
with opposite momenta in a quark-gluon plasma. The Leading and Secondary Quarks'
transverse momenta and angular separation are stored in a .csv file for each trial.
This .csv file can then be processed by the decorrelationPlotter.py program, which
bins the data and does some fitting to determine the Mean and FWHM of the distribution.
